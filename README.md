# Deutsch Algorithm Project

This repository contains code and notebooks related to my Deutsch Algorithm and Quantum computing project. It explores Quantum Computing, Quantum principles and The Deutsch Algorithm. In this project, I use Python to demonstrate Quantum Circuits with the Qiskit library.

## Contents

- Practical tasks related to the topic. (tasks.ipynb)
- Main project. (project.ipynb)
- Extra assets used in the project/tasks. (assets)

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the power of quantum computing through practical implementations of quantum algorithms, such as the Deutsch Algorithm.

## How to use

To run the code or notebooks in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
`$ git clone https://github.com/PieroniJV/Assessment.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
`$ cd your-repo`
3. Install the required dependencies:
- `jupyter`: To run the notebook.
- `qiskit`: A comprehensive quantum computing library.
- `NumPy`:  A library for numerical computations in Python.
- `matplotlib`: A library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
`$ pip install jupyter qiskit numpy matplotlib qiskit-aer`
4. Open the Jupyter Notebooks using your preferred environment: 
`$ jupyter notebook`
