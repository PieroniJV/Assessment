    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM defines quantum computing as <q>*a rapidly-emerging tehcnology* that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems **too complex for classical computers.**</q> [[1]](#1)\n",
    "In classical computing, calculations are executed using bits as the fundamental unit of information, where each bit can represent either 0 or 1. In contrast, quantum computers utilize *qubits (quantum bits)*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike classical bits, a qubit is not limited to a single, definitive state of 0 or 1; rather, it can exist in multiple states simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "This unique property is called *superposition* and allows quantum computers to process a significantly larger number of possibilities than their classical counterparts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Qubits exhibit a distinctive characteristic known as *entanglement*, wherein the state of one qubit is intricately linked to the state of another, irrespective of the physical separation between them. This phenomenon, known as entanglement, forms a foundational element in quantum computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computers harness not only entanglement but also another crucial property known as *interference* to enhance computational efficiency. Through the strategic utilization of entanglement and interference, quantum computers optimize their computational capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use quantum computing?\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the growing prevalence of large classical computers equipped with an increasing number of CPU and GPU cores, their fundamental limitation lies in their binary operation. If a supercomputer encounters challenges, it is typically because the **complex problem** at hand exceeds the capabilities of these large classical machines.<q>Complex problems are problems with lots of variables interacting in complicated ways.</q>[[2]](#2) The failure of classical computers is often rooted in their inherent difficulty handling **high levels of complexity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "As technology continues to advance, the **complexity of problems also escalates**, necessitating the adoption of *quantum computing*. This heightened complexity underscores the demand for quantum computing solutions. Presently, various fields leverage quantum computing technology to address **intricate challenges**, including but not limited to cryptography, machine learning, and calculations involving large factorial numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Deutsch's Algorithm\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*Deutsch's Algorithm*, formulated by David Deutsch in 1985, is designed to tackle the \"black-box problem,\" a specific computational challenge that will be further examined in the subsequent chapter. In classical computing, discerning whether an unknown function is constant or balanced necessitates multiple queries. In stark contrast, **Deutsch's Algorithm achieves this task with remarkable efficiency, requiring just a single quantum query**. The algorithm adeptly distinguishes between four distinct function types: **constant zero, constant one, balanced zero, and balanced one**. This demonstration highlights the quantum advantage, as it outperforms classical approaches by showcasing the capability of quantum computation to efficiently solve particular problems with a minimal number of queries."

    "\n",
    "As previously stated, the *black-box problem* addressed by **Deutsch's Algorithm** revolves around determining the nature of an *unknown function* encapsulated within a black box. This function takes a *single-bit input* and produces a *single-bit output*. The main challenge is to categorize the function into one of four possible types as seen below. \n",

    "- *Balanced Function (B1)*: Returns 1 for one input and 0 for the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to efficiently determine whether the black-box function falls into the category of a *constant function (either C0 or C1)* or a *balanced function (either B0 or B1)*. Emphasizing these four possible function types, **Deutsch's Algorithm** demonstrates a quantum advantage by solving this problem with just one query, showcasing the potency of quantum computation in specific problem domains.\n",

    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id='toc1_3_2_'></a>[Classical Solution](#toc0_)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the classical approach to solving the *black-box problem*, the strategy is to make queries to the *unknown function* within the blac-box. Here is how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <u>Query for input 0(Classical bit 0):</u> Query the black-box function with an input of 0.\n",
    "2. <u>Query for input 1(Classical bit 1):</u> Query the black-box function with an input of 1.\n",
    "3. <u>Compare outputs:</u> Examine the outputs for both queries. If the outputs are the same (both 0 or both 1), the function is classified as \"constant.\" If the outputs are different (one is 0 and the other is 1), the function is classified as \"balanced.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue with this approach is that this has a few limitations, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Query complexity:</u> This approach requires at least two queries to the function before it can determine if the function is *constant* or *balanced*. Which leads to the next limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Scalability issues:</u> As the *complexity of the problem* grows, and with larger input spaces or more intricate functions, the classical approach's query complexity increases linearly. This scalability issue makes the classical solution less efficient for complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <u>Inefficiency for Quantum Problems:</u> The *classical approach* contrasts with quantum algorithms like Deutsch's Algorithm, which demonstrate a *quantum advantage* by solving the problem with only one query. The classical method becomes inefficient when compared to quantum solutions for specific problems due to the inherent limitations of sequential query-based approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of less intricate problems, the *classical approach* remains effective. However, as the complexity of problems escalates or when grappling with quantum scenarios, the classical methodology becomes increasingly impractical. **Quantum problems**, in particular, often surpass the computational capacity of classical approaches, underscoring the need for quantum computing solutions in navigating challenges of heightened intricacy."

    "\n",
    "- **Quantum Algorithms:** Quantum algorithms, such as *Deutsch's Algorithm* and Grover's Algorithm, leverage interference to perform computations more efficiently than classical counterparts. They manipulate quantum states in a way that *constructive interference enhances the probability of measuring the correct answer while destructive interference reduces the probability of incorrect answers*.\n",

    "    - Prepare two qubits. Set the first qubit to $|0\\rangle$ and the second to $|1\\rangle$\n",
    "    - Apply a *Hadamard gate* to both qubits. This transforms the qubits into a *superpostion* of all possible states: $|00\\rangle + |01\\rangle$, where both are present with equal amplitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Oracle Circuit (Black-Box Function):**\n",
    "    - In this step, we apply the black-box function, often referred to as the oracle, to the qubits. The oracle represents the unknown function we want to evaluate.\n",
    "    - In the *Oracle function* we evaluate the two qubits as inputs and perform operations on them: $|xy\\rangle \\rightarrow |x, y \\oplus f(x)\\rangle$. \n",
    "    - In this function, $x \\text{ and } y$ represent the two qubits(inputs), $f(x)$ is the function to be evaluated and $\\oplus$ is the *XOR operation*, this combines the value of the second qubit $y(q1)$ with the output of the black-box function $f(x)$. This operation flips the second qubit if $f(x)$ is 1 and leaves it unchanged if $f(x)$ is 0.\n",

    "    - After applying the oracle function, we apply *Hadamard gates* to the first qubit $x(q0)$ again. \n",

    "- **Measurement:**\n",
    "    - In this final step, we measure the first qubit. The measurement result is either 0 or 1. The outcome of the measurement provides information about the nature of the black-box function: \n",
    "    - If the measurement result is 0, it indicates that the function $f(x)$ is *constant* (either C0 or C1).\n",
    "    - If the measurement result is 1, it indicates that the function $f(x)$ is *balanced* (either B0 or B1).\n",

    "- **Qubits** ($q0_0 \\text{ and } q0_1$).\n",
    "- **Gates** (`H`, Oracle($\\oplus$) and `H`):\n",
    "    - The `H` represents the Hadamard gates used to create a *superposition*.\n",
    "    - The *oracle function* applied to the qubits, which is a custom operation you define in your algorithm. \n",
    "- **Lines and Arrows**: \n",
    "    - The *lines* connecting the qubits and gates represent the quantum wires or qubits states. \n",
    "    - The *arrows* indicate the direction of the quantum operations, showing that the gates are applied to qubits.\n",
    "- **Classical bits** (`C0`): \n",
    "    - C0 is a classical bit abd it stores the measurement results. The label \"2/\" indicates that it is a 2-bit classical register.\n",
    "- **Measurement** (`M`): \n",
    "    - M represents the measurements performed on the qubits. The outcome is stored in the *classical bits*.\n",
    "- **Control flow**: \n",
    "    - The operations are performed in the order that they appear, from left to right."

    "The analysis is the most crucial part of the algorithm, where the nature of the black-box function is determined(*constant or balanced*). \n",
    "Here is how we can analyze the results of the simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieve the outcomes:**\n",
    "    By using `results.get_counts(circuit)` we can obtain the outcomes and then store it in the `counts` variable.\n",
    "2. **Understanding the outcomes:**\n",
    "    The outcomes represent the possible states of the qubits after measurement, along with the number of times each outcome was observed. These outcomes are in the form of binary strings, where the first digit represents the measurement result for `q0` and the second digit represnts the measurement result for `q1`. \n",
    "3. **Interpretation of the outcomes:**\n",
    "    As previously seen:\n",
    "    - If the measurement outcomes contain only the states *00 and 11*, it indicates that the black-box function is **constant**. This means that the oracle function applied to the qubits *does not depend on the input and has a constant output*.\n",
    "    - If the measurement outcomes contain both *01 and 10*, it indicates that the black-box function is **balanced**. This means that *the oracle function applied to the qubits changes the state of the second qubit based on the input*.\n",
    "4. **Probability analysis:**\n",
    "    One of the last steps is to examine the probabilities associated with each measurement outcome. \n",
    "    - In a **balanced** function, a roughly equal probability should be observed for `01` and `10` outcomes.\n",
    "    - In a **constant** function, you should see a higher probability for either `00` or `11`.\n",
    "5. **Final decision:**\n",
    "    Once you have the outcomes and probabilities, you can make a final decision regarding the nature of the black-box function. As previously discussed, If you observe only `00` and `11` outcomes, conclude that the function is **constant**. If you observe both `01` and `10` outcomes, conclude that the function is **balanced**.\n",

    "### <a id='toc1_9_1_'></a>[Comparison with Classical Approach](#toc0_)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few reasons as to why Quantum algorithms, such as the Deutsch's Algorithm, are more advantageous than classical methods. Here are some of these advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Speed:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Deutsch's Algorithm** provides a significant speedup over classical methods for solving the problem it addresses. In the classical case, to determine whether a black-box function is *constant or balanced*, you would need to evaluate the function for at least half of its input space. In contrast, Deutsch's Algorithm requires *only one query to the function*, regardless of its input size. This demonstrates the power of **quantum parallelism**, where quantum computers can *evaluate multiple inputs simultaneously*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Determinism:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deutsch's Algorithm** always produces a deterministic result. When the algorithm concludes that the black-box function is constant or balanced, it is *certain of the answer*. Classical algorithms may require *multiple evaluations*, and even then, there might be uncertainty due to probabilistic algorithms or incomplete evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Constant function detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of **constant functions**, **Deutsch's Algorithm** can identify the function as constant with certainty after *one query*. In contrast, a **classical algorithm** might require an exhaustive search, which can be *time-consuming* for large input spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Balanced Function Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "For balanced functions, **Deutsch's Algorithm** also excels. It can identify the function as balanced after *one query*. In the **classical case**, determining whether a function is balanced would *require checking multiple inputs* and observing changes in the output, which could be a *resource-intensive process*.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  5. Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deutsch's Algorithm** demonstrates the efficiency of quantum computation. It performs the task with *fewer resources* (queries) than **classical** algorithms, making it *highly efficient* for this specific problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <u>Limitations and Considerations:</u> \n",
    "\n",
    "While **Deutsch's Algorithm** provides advantages for specific problems, it is important to note that *not all problems experience such quantum speedup*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum algorithms** are *highly specialized* and designed to excel in specific problem domains. In contrast, **classical algorithms** are *more versatile* and can be applied to various types of problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum algorithms require **quantum hardware**, which is currently in the early stages of development. Quantum computers are *not yet widely available*, and building and maintaining quantum hardware can be *expensive and challenging*."

It stands as a *specialized solution, accompanied by cost considerations and limited availability*, a reminder that quantum computing, though promising, is *yet to fully unfold its potential*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As we conclude our exploration, we glimpse both the brilliance and the boundaries of quantum algorithms like Deutsch's. The quest for harnessing the full spectrum of quantum capabilities continues, *promising an exciting future* where quantum and classical computing coalesce in pursuit of the profound unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id='toc1_10_2_'></a>[Significance of Quantum Advantage](#toc0_)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deutsch's Algorithm**, as we've explored in this notebook, stands as a testament to the transformative potential of **quantum computing**. Its ability to determine the nature of an unknown function with just *one query* has profound implications for problem-solving and computation at large. In this section, we reflect on the significance of the **quantum advantage** demonstrated by Deutsch's Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As seen, **speed, efficiency and complexity** are all handled by the **quantum algorithm**, which in contrast with **classical algorithms**, has a much *better performance and guarantees a deterministic result*. It also becomes evident how powerful the quantum algorithm is when we consider some of the *limitations of the classical algorithms*, such as *exhaustive evaluations of functions across their input space*, which increases the resources needed for evaluating more complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantum Parallellism:** This is a foundational concept in **quantum computing**. It allows **quantum algorithms** to *processs and explore multiple possibilites simultaneously*, leading to *exponential speedup* for certain problems. Through the principle of **superposition**, a **qubit** can represent *multiple states simultaneously*. This allows quantum algorithms to explore and *process many possibilities in parallel*.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In conclusion, Deutsch's Algorithm significantly impacts the landscape of computational theory. It stands as both a **promising and powerful** testament to the potential of quantum computing. This algorithm not only demonstrates the unique capabilities of quantum mechanics in processing information but also heralds a future where *complex problems find their solutions in the realm of quantum computing*. As we continue to explore and develop these quantum frontiers, Deutsch's Algorithm remains a *pivotal milestone*, underscoring the bright and transformative prospects that quantum computing holds for solving intricate challenges.\n"
