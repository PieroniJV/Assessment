    "### Overview of Quantum Computing\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM defines quantum computing as <q>a rapidly-emerging tehcnology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers.<q>  In classical computing, calculations are executed using bits as the fundamental unit of information, where each bit can represent either 0 or 1. In contrast, quantum computers utilize qubits (quantum bits). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike classical bits, a qubit is not limited to a single, definitive state of 0 or 1; rather, it can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This unique property is called superposition and allows quantum computers to process a significantly larger number of possibilities than their classical counterparts. Qubits exhibit a distinctive characteristic known as entanglement, wherein the state of one qubit is intricately linked to the state of another, irrespective of the physical separation between them. This phenomenon, known as entanglement, forms a foundational element in quantum computing. Quantum computers harness not only entanglement but also another crucial property known as interference to enhance computational efficiency. Through the strategic utilization of entanglement and interference, quantum computers optimize their computational capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use quantum computing?\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the growing prevalence of large classical computers equipped with an increasing number of CPU and GPU cores, their fundamental limitation lies in their binary operation. If a supercomputer encounters challenges, it is typically because the complex problem at hand exceeds the capabilities of these large classical machines. The failure of classical computers is often rooted in their inherent difficulty handling high levels of complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As technology continues to advance, the complexity of problems also escalates, necessitating the adoption of quantum computing. This heightened complexity underscores the demand for quantum computing solutions. Presently, various fields leverage quantum computing technology to address intricate challenges, including but not limited to cryptography, machine learning, and calculations involving large factorial numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Deutsch's Algorithm\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Deutsch's Algorithm, formulated by David Deutsch in 1985, is designed to tackle the \"black-box problem,\" a specific computational challenge that will be further examined in the subsequent chapter. In classical computing, discerning whether an unknown function is constant or balanced necessitates multiple queries. In stark contrast, Deutsch's Algorithm achieves this task with remarkable efficiency, requiring just a single quantum query. The algorithm adeptly distinguishes between four distinct function types: constant zero, constant one, balanced zero, and balanced one. This demonstration highlights the quantum advantage, as it outperforms classical approaches by showcasing the capability of quantum computation to efficiently solve particular problems with a minimal number of queries."

    "\n",
    "The term opacity in this context refers to the fact that it is difficult to understand why machines(AI) do what they do or how they work. In the Deutsch's Algorithm, particularly, a given function takes a single-bit input and produces a single-bit output. Such function can be of 4 types: </p>\n",

    "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is a quantum algorithm that was first proposed by David Deutsch in 1985 and later expanded by Richard Jozsa in 1992. In a brief way, this is how the algorith is set-up. \"We want to find out whether a particular function, with one input bit and one output bit is constant or balanced.Classically, we need to evaluate the function twice (i.e., for input = 0 and input = 1), but remarkably, we only need to evaluate the function once quantumly, by using Deutschâ€™s algorithm.[[2]](#clcam)\"</p>"
